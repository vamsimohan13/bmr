document extraction framework
This fork from docx4j provides a few more value-adds :-
1) Ability to configure "parse template" in docx. Uses a visitor pattern
2) Support all cross format composition with "reasonable data conversion".
for ex. docx to pptx - convert at page level preserving word styles
for ex. docx to xlsx - convert tables in docx to worksheets with image embedding
